# rossum
v0.2.1

This is `rossum`, a CMake-like build file generator for Fanuc Robotics (Karel)
projects.


## Overview

This tool introduces a package based workflow for Karel development: packages are directories that contain a marker file (a *manifest*) that contains some metadata describing the dependencies of that package and any translatable targets. Detection of packages and generation of the build file is done once at configuration time, relying on the build tool's dependency resolution to build all targets in the correct order.


## Installation

1. Install Git & Python
2. (optional) Create a python virtual environment `python -m venv <name>`
3. Install Ninja from https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases. Download the `ninja-win.zip` file, and extract to a user specified directory. Make sure you add this to your environment `Path`.
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";" + "path\to\ninja", "User");
```
4. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/kobbled/rossum` to a user specified directory. If using an python virtual environment this can be cloned within your venv is you so choose.
5. Run the install file in a powershell terminal, with the optional argument specifying the path to your created venv.
```powershell
. ./install.ps1 <path\to\venv>
```

Alternatively a convenience distribution can be downloaded from https://github.com/kobbled/rossum/releases. Simply extract to a user specified location, and add this location to your environment `Path`.

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";" + "path\to\rossum-distrib", "User");
```

</br>

> [!**IMPORTANT**]
> make sure you add any external libraries or projects that are dependencies (such as [Ka-Boost](https://github.com/kobbled/Ka-Boost)) to the environment variable `ROSSUM_PKG_PATH`. See [Environment Variables](https://github.com/kobbled/rossum#environment-variables) for more details.


</br>

> [!**NOTE**]
>
> On windows machines the `python` alias can be overwritten by the py launcher where python is started in the terminal with `py -3`. The batch files are written with the `python` key. To create the alias type this into powershell:
> ```powershell
> Set-Alias -Name python -Value "path\to\Python\Python39\python.exe"
> ```
> replacing the value with the full path to the python executable in your PATH environment variables.

</br>

> [!**WARNING**]
>
> If you installed rossum with the _"install.ps1"_ script the steps in [Requirements](https://github.com/kobbled/rossum#Requirements), and [Dependencies](https://github.com/kobbled/rossum#Dependencies) are not needed. If you are trying to setup in a linux/unix environment follow the steps below.

</br>

## Requirements

* **Rossum** was written in Python 3. Python dependencies can be installed with
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Add the _./bin_ directory of **Rossum** to your environment `Path`
* The generated Ninja build files require a recent (> 1.7.1) version of [Ninja][] to be present. Please install [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) on your machine, and make sure the binary is located on your envrionment `Path`.
* FANUC Roboguide must also be installed with OPLC bin programs, **maketp**, **ktrans**, and **setrobot**. These tools can be typically found in `C:\Program Files (x86)\FANUC\WinOLPC\bin`. An emulation of your workcell should be made through Roboguide or OLPCpro, typically stored in *%USERPROFILE%/Documents/My Workcells*. Once a workcell has been created, and _robot.ini_ file needs to be generated in the root of your rossum project. The _robot.ini_ file can be generated by typing `setrobot` into a terminal opened in the root directory of your project, and selecting the appropriate workcell.
* Add the following to your environment variables, and change the values according to your system
```shell
# Rossum specific variables
set ROSSUM_CORE_VERSION=V910-1
set ROSSUM_PKG_PATH \path\to\rossum\dependency\packages
set ROSSUM_SERVER_IP 127.0.0.1
```

See [Environment Variables](https://github.com/kobbled/rossum#environment-variables) for more details on usage.

> [!**NOTE**]
> 
> If using **TP+**, and link to you controller environment file must be placed in the _robot.ini_ like:
> `ENV=C:\path\to\env.tpp`

## Dependencies

* [ktransw](https://github.com/kobbled/ktransw_py) must be installed on your system for Rossum to compile karel files. follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/kobbled/ktransw_py#Requirements) for installation. **ktransw** is included as a submodule of this package in _"./deps/ktransw"_. Make sure that _"./deps/ktransw/bin"_, and _"./deps/ktransw/gpp"_ are on your environment `Path`.
* [yamljson2xml](https://github.com/kobbled/yamljson2xml) is required to convert _.yaml_. or _.json_ files to xml to be sent to the controller. Currently Fanuc cannot read or parse _.yaml_. or _.json_, but can read _.xml_ files. Follow this installation instructions [here](https://github.com/kobbled/yamljson2xml), and make sure the necessary locations are added to your environment `Path`.

## Examples

Please see [rossum_example_ws][] for an example workspace with some packages
that show how to use `rossum`.

## currently handled files

* Karel (.kl)
* LS files (.ls)
* TP-Plus (.tpp)
* JSON (.json)
* YAML (.yaml)
* CSV (.csv)
* FANUC Dictionary (.utx)
* FANUC Form (.ftx)

> [!**NOTE**]
>
>Look at the User Form example in [rossum_example_ws][], *basic_test\lib_a*. Preprocessor directives have been expanded in .utx, and .ftx files using [ktransw][]. In order to properly compile dictionary files, `ninja` might have to be run twice to first create the karel include file, and then build the accompanying karel file. 


## Usage

                        dir
  --ftp                 Use IP address in environment variable 
                        'ENV_SERVER_IP' to send files in build folder to
                        Controller with 'kpush' command.
  -o --override         Will override environment variables with contents of
                        robot.ini file.

                        just interpret to .ls.
  -t  --include-tests   include test files in build
  -i  --build-interfaces   build tp interfaces for karel 
                        routines specified in package.json.
                        This is needed to use karel routines within a tp program
  -D  /D                Define user macros from command line
  --clean               clean all files out of build directory
```

## robot.ini file example

create robot.ini file in the top level of the source directory calling **setrobot** through a command prompt, and selecting the correct workcell created with Roboguide. *Ftp*, and *Env* will need to be added afterwards as they are Rossum specific directives.

```

### tp-interfaces

Teach pendant interfaces are a way of exposing karel routines, for usage in teach pendant (TP) programs. Inherently you are not allowed to access karel routines with the *CALL* function in TP programs. You are able to call karel programs within TP programs. Rossum provides a way to automatically create a karel program wrapper around a specified routine. For instance if you want to expose a routine definition:

```
ROUTINE func01(i : INTEGER; r : REAL; p : XYZWPR) : INTEGER
```

and create a wrapper program called **tp_func01**, you can define an interface in the package manifest:

```
"tp-interfaces" : [
    {"routine" : "func01", "program_name" : "tp_func01"}
  ]
```

This will output a karel program to \<src\>/tp/ . If there is a return type the last arguement will be the register number to store the result in.

If an input argument is a position type, the corresponding TPE arguement is the position register number where the input data is stored.

**currently handled types**

* INTEGER
* REAL
* STRING
* XYZWPR
* JOINTPOS

### user macros

package/project wide pre-processor macros can be defined either from the command line or the package manifest. From the command line macros are invoked the same way they are in GPP (see [GPP documentation][GPP]), with **-D***name=val*, or **/D***name=val*. Macros can be included in the package manifest as shown in [example package.json](#packagejson-file-example).

## Environment variables

```shell
# environment pointers
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\path\to\rossum\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\path\to\rossum\deps\ktransw\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\path\to\rossum\deps\ktransw\gpp
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\path\to\rossum\deps\yamljson2xml\src
```

```shell
# Rossum specific variables
set ROSSUM_CORE_VERSION=V910-1
set ROSSUM_PKG_PATH \path\to\rossum\dependency\packages
set ROSSUM_SERVER_IP 127.0.0.1
```

`rossum` checks for the existence of two environment variables and uses their
contents to change its behaviour.

### ROSSUM_PKG_PATH

The `ROSSUM_PKG_PATH` should contain (a) path(s) to one or more directories
containing rossum packages. All directories will be searched when running `rossum` so that the full paths of these packages do not need to be specified, merely the _name_ of the package.

For example if you have the dependency [Strings](https://github.com/kobbled/strings) on your project, you would add the location where you put the **Strings** repo (i.e. `C:\path\to\rossum\dependency\packages`) to `ROSSUM_PKG_PATH`. Then in the _package.json_ file simply add the name of the package:

```
"depends" : [
    "Strings"
  ],
```
Rossum now has visibility to the Strings package.

### ROSSUM_CORE_VERSION

The `ROSSUM_CORE_VERSION` variable can be used to specify a 'system wide'
default core version that should be used for all invocations of `ktransw`,
unless the default is overriden using the `--core` option.

Example: to make version 8.30 of the support files the default set
`ROSSUM_CORE_VERSION` to `V8.30-1`.


## Glossary

Terminology used by `rossum`.

### package
A directory containing any number of source and header files, organised into
`src` and `include` sub directories, along with a JSON package manifest. The
manifest declares translationable binary targets and additional meta-data such
as build dependencies (other `rossum` packages), author, version and test
binaries.

### workspace
A directory containing a set of `rossum` compatible packages. Note that while
possible, packages are typically not directly stored in the top-level workspace
directory, but in a *source space* sub directory.

### source space
The sub directory of the *workspace* that contains a set of of `rossum`
compatible packages. Usually named `src`.

### build space
The sub directory of the *workspace* that will store all the build output
(p-code files).

### build file
The ninja build file generated by `rossum` at the end of the configuration
phase.
